## 💼 How to Present This Project

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
*"I built a Universal AI Workspace that combines document intelligence, code analysis, and task management using RAG and multi-agent architecture. It's like having ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Notion AI in one personal, private system."*

### Technical Overview (2 minutes)
*"The backend uses FastAPI with LangChain to orchestrate 4 specialized AI agents. Each agent is an expert - Code Agent for development, Document Agent for files, Task Agent for productivity, and Research Agent for general queries. The system implements RAG with ChromaDB for personal knowledge storage, and the frontend is built with Next.js 14 for a modern, responsive experience."*

### Business Pitch (1 minute)
*"This addresses a real market need - professionals want AI that understands their specific context and remembers their information. Unlike ChatGPT which forgets everything, this system builds a personal knowledge base. The SaaS potential is huge - targeting knowledge workers willing to pay $20-50/month for a truly personalized AI assistant."*
